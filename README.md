### Objectives
1. How our local districts in Columbia and Montour Counties are trending since 2015?
2. How they compare to the state trend since 2015?
3. Is there any COVID impact we might be able to deduce?
4. Any other information that data might tell us?
5. Visualizing the averages of scores from each year.
   - As a whole
   - Grouped by subject
   - Grouped by district
6. Compare scores between districts.
7. Study cohorts as they progress from PSSA to Keystone

### 3. Is there any COVID impact we might be able to deduce?
...*BelowBasic*: Colombia County outperformed State and Montour County prior to COVID.
...After COVID, Colombia County suffered some against State Level. Montour County ranked the worst

...was a slight delcine in scores possibly due to COVID

...As graph suggests, all baseline levels experienced some decline in scores due to COVID
...with one exception. As a matter of fact in 2021, there was a spike in Advanced Baseline which 
...suggests that COVID was not a determinator for scores in this level.
...Proficient level seemed to suffer the most due to COVID19 pandemic.
